# Bubble Sort (Descending Order)

This program reads a list of integers from a text file, sorts them in **descending order** using the Bubble Sort algorithm, and measures the execution time.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Files
- `main.py` – contains the bubble sort implementation
- `dataset.txt` – text file containing integers (one number per line)

## How to Run
1. Make sure `main.py` and `dataset.txt` are in the same directory.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in that directory.
3. Run the program using:
   ```bash
   python main.py
